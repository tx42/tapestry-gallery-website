                  The biblical story of slander against Susana appears in Book
                  of Daniel. There Elders, failing to press heroine into
                  submission, arrested her with the claim that she was
                  committing adultery.However, Daniel managed to uncover their
                  scheme. Tapestries with this subject were popular from the
                  late Middle Ages onwards.

                with one hand behind his back. The other players slap the hand
                making it ‘hot’ while the hand’s owner has to guess who is

                The otter hunt shown in this tapestry is rather gruesome.
                Otters were hunted not to eat but for their skins and because
                they ate the fish that were needed for the table. Swan meat
                was, however, highly desirable and here boys are seen robbing
                a swan’s nest. At one time, swans could be owned only by the
                royal family but as they gradually escaped into the wild they
                became fair game for other people, although theoretically they
                could only be hunted by licence. A ferocious bear hunt is seen
                on the right with oriental figures wearing turbans.

                  By the 15th century all types of hunting had their own rules.
                  Deer hunting was known as the sport of kings and confined to
                  the courts and other favoured individuals. In this tapestry
                  the main scenes show various parts of the deer hunt,
                  including, at the centre bottom, a dead deer being cut up and
                  the meat distributed. This was carried out as a set ritual
                  with specific cuts of the meat being given to particular
                  huntsmen and favoured dogs.
